1. LOGIN function
    - Give user the JWT and Refresh Token
2. POKEMON parts of the db
3. THEN WE GO CLIENT SIDE:
    - Get random POKEMON
    - Get specific POKEMON

    SIMPLE WAY TO OPEN IMAGES "os/exec": 
        cmd = exec.Command("xdg-open", imagePath)
        err := cmd.Run()

    After that, however, we probably want to implement through an external library
    Our main choice right now: Ebitengine
    We can also try to learn Fyne instead
