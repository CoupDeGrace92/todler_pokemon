CURRENT:
2. Client Side - RANDOM CATCHING CHANCE
    Once caught - fetch pokemon with pokeapi using our db, then store temp image locally
    Defer deleting local temp files?  Or just keep them stored locally.
3. Create REPL for commands, pokedex to look up users pokemon
4. Add image pop-up
5. Do something with Queries/endpoints that allow for searching
6. Actually implement use of refresh tokens (right now, we generate them but do not use them to return a new JWT)

CURRENT - REPL for cli integration


TODO WHEN WE HAVE FRONT END CACHING
WE want versioning controlling front end caching:
    007_metadata_table - table for versioning including major and minor versioning
    major version changes when db architecture changes
    minor version changes when we just make meaningful data changes on the back end (new pulls from pokeAPI)

    On requests from the backend, versioning func that adds a header "X-Version" <major>.<minor>

WE ALSO WANT:
Gradient coloring of pokemon based on type using ASCI codes like in the pokedex entry


CURRENT TASK - HANDLERS FOR UPDATING TEAMS BETWEEN BACK AND FRONT END
