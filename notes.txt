1. LOGIN function
    - Give user the JWT and Refresh Token
2. POKEMON parts of the db
3. THEN WE GO CLIENT SIDE:
    - Get random POKEMON
    - Get specific POKEMON

    SIMPLE WAY TO OPEN IMAGES "os/exec": 
        cmd = exec.Command("xdg-open", imagePath)
        err := cmd.Run()

    After that, however, we probably want to implement through an external library
    Our main choice right now: Ebitengine
    We can also try to learn Fyne instead



Think about how we want to deal with storing the POKEMON
    - DB storage
    - Local only for temp testing or single use cases
    - Do we want to use async delivery for multiplayer?



CURRENT:
0. Add cache to reduce stress on PokeAPI - see PokeDex/internal/pokecache.go for implementation
1. Pokemon Teams DB
2. Client Side - RANDOM CATCHING CHANCE
    Once caught - fetch pokemon with pokeapi using our db, then store temp image locally
    Defer deleting local temp files?  Or just keep them stored locally.
3. Create REPL for commands, pokedex to look up users pokemon
4. Add image pop-up
